  "body": "#How It Works\r\nJust scan the barcode on your food and put it in the microwave. The UPC code is then inputted into our microwave time UPC server and then the time will be transferred back to the microwave. The microwave then runs for the time sent back.\r\n#Powered By The Raspberry Pi\r\n\r\n![http://cdn1.alphr.com/sites/alphr/files/6/14/raspberry_pi_b_2_0_0.jpg](http://cdn1.alphr.com/sites/alphr/files/6/14/raspberry_pi_b_2_0_0.jpg)\r\n#Our Recipe\r\n##Ingredients\r\n* 1 baked 9-inch pie crust\r\n* 4 to 5 c frozen raspberries, slightly thawed--best if not entirely thawed\r\n* 3/4 c sugar\r\n* 3 T corn starch\r\n* 1 T lemon juice (may use reconstituted)\r\n\r\n##Instrutions\r\n1. Merge the sugar and cornstarch, mixing thoroughly.\r\n2. Measure 1 cup of the juices of the thawing raspberries into a large microwave-safe bowl. (If you do not have quite a cup of juice, you may add a bit of water to reach the one cup level.) Gradually stir in the sugar and cornstarch mixture.\r\n3. Microwave on MEDIUM for 3 to 4 minutes, occasionally stirring until the mixture bubbles up and is thick and translucent. Remove from microwave and stir in the lemon juice. Allow to cool for a few minutes.\r\n4. Fold the remaining berries into the cooked mixture and pour into the prepared pie shell. Chill before serving.",
